# V2T-Tools

A repository to store tools and artifacts related to V2T migrations.

## V2T-Assessment

A quick Powershell script which takes a PowerNSX Capture Bundle as input and uses the Pester testing framework to run a series of tests against the configuration.

The script is designed to provide assistance when looking at a NSX-v configuration to find the needles in the haystack that might cause headaches when trying to to a manual/scripted migration.
